    "abstract": "When were are asked to write the polynomial $p(x)=3x^2 +x^4 +7-x$ in standard
form we know our answer is $x^4+3x^2-x+7$, because the only way to order powers of $x$ totally while being consistent with multiplication is the natural one: degree wise! Complexity is introduced when we are asked to write $q(x)=2x^3yz^2-6x^4z+x^2y^3z$ in standard form and we have to define what standard form means in this setting.

In this talk we will introduce the concept of Monomial Orders through examples, discuss the basics of their matrix representations, present the three classical monomial orders (lexicographic, degree lexicographic and reverse lexicographic) and explore a curious property they possess (hint: it is in the title), and present results found in joint work with undergraduates in 2016 and 2023 at Amherst College and Colgate University, respectively,  seeking to characterize other monomial orders possessing this 'reconstructible' property.

The only background needed for (most of) this talk is basic linear algebra!

    "abstract": "Different choices for modeling disturbance to a dynamical system can lead to different predictions of future outcomes. For example, when modeling population growth, traditional techniques use a continuous disturbance to model removing part of the population. However, if the disturbance is relatively fast compared to the recovery period, we can choose to remove part of the population instantaneously in a type of impulsive differential equation that I like to call a flow-kick system. In this talk I'll introduce flow-kick systems and show that when maintaining a constant disturbance rate, flow-kick systems can have qualitatively different outcomes than their analogous continuous systems if the time between disturbances is large enough. I'll discuss some theory briefly but mainly focus on applications, including fires in savannas and human immune system reaction to reoccurring exposure to a virus.",

Combinatorial Games are two player (usually alternating), deterministic games (no flipping coins, tossing dice, ...) and with perfect information (each player knows all information available about the state of the game. Nothing is hidden). 
On the other hand continued fractions are a special type of fractions that form under the following rules: \"add a fraction to an existing fraction‚Äôs denominator.\" 
In this talk we will present some old and new results about complementary sequences, see how some of they arise as winning strategies for combinatorial games and how these sequences relate to continued fractions and other mathematical objects like dynamical systems.",
    "bio": "My name is Gerem√≠as Polanco and I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Smith College.

In this area of mathematics we study the integers which are the numbers $\\cdots -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\cdots$
and their generalizations. My research uses tools from combinatorics (counting techniques), tools from algebra and tools from analysis (a sophisticated version of calculus) to solve problems involving the integers, and I actively mentor students in this endeavor.

To be more specific, I investigate number theoretic and combinatorial properties of complementary integer sequences, especially those that are increasing. My research spans analyzing their inherent properties, exploring various generation methods, examining related mathematical constructs, and applying them in areas such as combinatorial games where these sequences emerge as solutions. I also study problems in uniform distribution theory, a central area in mathematics, that provides a framework to understand how sequences spread out over a specific interval or space. Finally I am lately working on some problems that require the use of analysis and algebra to better understand prime numbers and their properties.

Professionally, I have three main passions:

1. I am passionate about engaging in collaborative research with students and other colleagues, particularly delving into intriguing challenges in number theory.
2. My enthusiasm lies in effective teaching and conveying mathematical concepts to diverse audiences, with a special emphasis on undergraduate students.
3. My ultimate aim is to contribute to the establishment of a more inclusive mathematics community by breaking down barriers that hinder access and by providing support to all individuals, enabling them to flourish within the field of mathematics.

These methods typically require that our data is described with respect to a relatively small set of variables or that we provide distances among all pairs of points.  For many interesting problems, however, this initial step can be quite challenging.  In such a case, we may instead wish to work from a set of responses to similarity comparisons (e.g., among x, y, and z, which one is the outlier?).  In this talk, I will introduce cohesion, a new measure of relative proximity that is built on this comparison framework.  We‚Äôll see how cohesion offers a perspective on our data that is quite different from distance alone and can help address challenges that arise in high-dimensional settings.  I will also share some initial progress toward the development of cohesion-based methods for clustering and data visualization."

Mathematically one can also conjure up many symmetric objects: even and odd functions, fractals, certain matrices, and modular forms, a type of symmetric complex function. All of these things exhibit a kind of beauty in their symmetries, so would they lose some of their innate beauty if their symmetries were altered? Alternatively, could some measure of beauty be gained with slight symmetric imperfections? We will explore these questions guided by the topic of modular forms and their variants. What can be gained by perturbing modular symmetries in particular?

What is/are the corresponding minimizer(s)? Using multivariable calculus, we will answer these questions and explore some of the properties of the solution(s). We will then try to see how the solution changes when we have $ 4, 5, \\dots, N $ vectors instead of 3."

  "title": "Comparing Songs without Listening: From Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science to Music and Back Again",
  "abstract": "Music is deeply entrenched in our daily lives, from our playlists to the background songs in our favorite television shows. The multidisciplinary field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is motivated by the comparisons that we, as humans, make about music and the various contexts of these comparisons. By defining tasks such as building better song recommendation systems or finding structural information in a given recording, MIR seeks to algorithmically make these musical comparisons in the same manner that a human being would, but on a much larger scale. In this talk, we will introduce the field of MIR, including popular tasks and cutting edge techniques. Then we will present aligned hierarchies, a structure-based representation that can be used for comparing songs, and new extensions of aligned hierarchies that leverage ideas from topological data analysis."
