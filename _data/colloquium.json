In spite of the simple name, simple equation, and simple statement, however, the conjecture turns out to be a quite subtle statement in number theory.

In this talk, we will motivate and state the $abc$-conjecture. To help us get there, we'll spend most of our time looking at the related case of putting polynomials, rather than integers, in the roles of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

No background beyond Math 111 is needed for this talk.",

    "title": "On Numbers… and Patterns… and Games… and Greed",
    "abstract": "Two sequences are complementary if their union gives the positive integers and their intersection is empty. For instance, the even and odd numbers are two complementary sequences. Similarly, the prime and composite numbers form another pair of complementary sequences.
Combinatorial Games are two player (usually alternating), deterministic games (no flipping coins, tossing dice, ...) and with perfect information (each player knows all information available about the state of the game. Nothing is hidden). 
On the other hand continued fractions are a special type of fractions that form under the following rules: \"add a fraction to an existing fraction’s denominator.\" 
In this talk we will present some old and new results about complementary sequences, see how some of they arise as winning strategies for combinatorial games and how these sequences relate to continued fractions and other mathematical objects like dynamical systems.",
    "bio": "My name is Geremías Polanco and I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Smith College. I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and my area of specialization is Number Theory. In this area of mathematics we study the integers which are the numbers $\\cdots -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\cdots$
and their generalizations. My research uses tools from combinatorics (counting techniques), tools from algebra and tools from analysis (a sophisticated version of calculus) to solve problems involving the integers, and I actively mentor students in this endeavor.

To be more specific, I investigate number theoretic and combinatorial properties of complementary integer sequences, especially those that are increasing. My research spans analyzing their inherent properties, exploring various generation methods, examining related mathematical constructs, and applying them in areas such as combinatorial games where these sequences emerge as solutions. I also study problems in uniform distribution theory, a central area in mathematics, that provides a framework to understand how sequences spread out over a specific interval or space. Finally I am lately working on some problems that require the use of analysis and algebra to better understand prime numbers and their properties.

Professionally, I have three main passions:

1. I am passionate about engaging in collaborative research with students and other colleagues, particularly delving into intriguing challenges in number theory.
2. My enthusiasm lies in effective teaching and conveying mathematical concepts to diverse audiences, with a special emphasis on undergraduate students.
3. My ultimate aim is to contribute to the establishment of a more inclusive mathematics community by breaking down barriers that hinder access and by providing support to all individuals, enabling them to flourish within the field of mathematics.
I was born in the Dominican Republic where I completed my undergraduate studies. After completing my Phd I moved to the Pioneer Valley where I worked as an Assistant professor at Hampshire College for 6 years, as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Amherst College for 1 year, and I have been at Smith since 2020.  I love baseball (being a good dominican myself) and other outdoor activities.On Saturday nights, I am likely to be playing board games with my family and any friends that may join us."

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental concepts of analysis is the fourier transform, which translates information about a function into information about its frequencies. One of the fundamental concepts of algebra is the homomorphism, which translates information about one structured set into information about another structured set. While on the surface these two concepts are unrelated, Gauss discovered some connections between the two. In fact, it turns out that sometimes the two concepts carry equivalent information! Although the talk will include some results that are new, the main ideas should be accessible to all; in particular, I will introduce all the relevant concepts.",

In 2014 he joined the Williams math/stat department, and has been inflicting mathematics and unforgivable puns on students ever since. He is the recipient of numerous awards, primarily for participation in little league soccer, and is one of the most highly-regarded mathematicians in his household.

    "abstract": "We often want to observe the shape of our data and will use clustering and data visualization methods to do so.  These methods typically require that our data is described with respect to a relatively small set of variables or that we provide distances among all pairs of points.  For many interesting problems, however, this initial step can be quite challenging.  In such a case, we may instead wish to work from a set of responses to similarity comparisons (e.g., among x, y, and z, which one is the outlier?).  In this talk, I will introduce cohesion, a new measure of relative proximity that is built on this comparison framework.  We’ll see how cohesion offers a perspective on our data that is quite different from distance alone and can help address challenges that arise in high-dimensional settings.  I will also share some initial progress toward the development of cohesion-based methods for clustering and data visualization."

There are different forms of the difference quotient, such as the forward difference (most common), backward difference and centered difference (more accurate). In this talk I will discuss several different differences, specifically nonstandard finite differences (NFSD) that can be used to approximate the derivatives that appear in differential equations as a solution technique. Many NSFD schemes have been discovered and promoted by Ronald E. Mickens, an African-American Emeritus Professor of Physics at Clark Atlanta University, who has written more than 300 research articles and a dozen books. I will present a number of examples of how NSFD schemes can be used to solve a variety of problems drawn from first-semester Calculus to elementary ordinary differential equations to advanced partial differential equations.

All students (faculty and staff) are welcome to attend.  Only knowledge of elementary derivatives/anti-derivatives and Taylor approximations will be assumed."

Quantum spin systems are powerful mathematical models of interacting quantum many-body systems. They are widely studied in condensed matter physics, mathematical physics as well as quantum information theory. On the other hand, since its introduction by John Roe, coarse geometry has remained a beautiful and effective description of large-scale behavior of spaces. After introducing both worlds separately, I will explain an on-going effort to connect the two through an idea called homology. I will only assume backgrounds in calculus and linear algebra."

For example, usual addition and multiplication are commutative operations, but subtraction, division, and composition of functions are non-commutative. We will introduce some 'non-commutative creatures' and we will delve into two interesting results: the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, in an alternate non-commutative world."

  "title": "Symmetry, Almost",
  "abstract": "Some definitions of the word symmetry include 'correct or pleasing proportion of the parts of a thing,' 'balanced proportions,' and 'the property of remaining invariant under certain changes, as of orientation in space.' One might think of snowflakes, butterflies, and our own faces as naturally symmetric objects– or at least close to it. Mathematically one can also conjure up many symmetric objects: even and odd functions, fractals, certain matrices, and modular forms, a type of symmetric complex function. All of these things exhibit a kind of beauty in their symmetries, so would they lose some of their innate beauty if their symmetries were altered? Alternatively, could some measure of beauty be gained with slight symmetric imperfections? We will explore these questions guided by the topic of modular forms and their variants. What can be gained by perturbing modular symmetries in particular? We will discuss this theme from past to present: the origins of these questions have their roots in the first half of the 20th century, dating back to Ramanujan and Gauss, while some fascinating and surprising answers come from just the last 15 years."

In this talk, we will introduce the field of MIR, including popular tasks and cutting edge techniques. Then we will present aligned hierarchies, a structure-based representation that can be used for comparing songs, and new extensions of aligned hierarchies that leverage ideas from topological data analysis."
