<h2>Cracking ElGamal</h2>

<i>All submissions due by 2pm on Friday, May 1.</i>

<p>
We have discussed two related cryptographic protocols in class: ElGamal encryption and ElGamal digital signatures. Both systems use the same type of public key, consisting of three numbers (<b>g</b>,<b>y</b>,<b>p</b>), where <b>p</b> is a prime number, <b>g</b> is a primitive root modulo <b>p</b>, and <b>y</b> is some number between 1 and <b>p</b>-1, inclusive. Call the owner of this public key Alice. Alice also knows a secret number <b>a</b> such that <b>g<sup>a</sup></b>≡<b>y</b> mod <b>p</b>. The security of both systems (encryption and signing) depend on the fact that it is computationally difficult to solve the discrete logarithm problem, and therefore to reconstruct the value of <b>a</b> from the values of <b>g</b> and <b>y</b> (as long as <b>p</b> is sufficiently large). This problem demonstrates a potential security flaw in ElGamal signatures (if implemented poorly) that can all an eavesdropper to determine <b>a</b>, and hence crack any documents encrypted with Alice's public key.
</p>

<p>
In each test case, you will receive Alice's public key, as well as two signed messages from Alice. Each signed message consists of three integers (<b>m,r,s</b>). These three values obey the congruence <b>g<sup>m</sup> ≡ y<sup>r</sup> r<sup>s</sup></b> mod <b>p</b> (the integrity of ElGamal signatures rests on the fact that it appears to be difficult to construct such numbers <b>r,s</b> for a fixed number <b>m</b> without knowledge of the secret number <b>a</b>). However, Alice has made a critical mistake while signing these two messages: she has used the same value of <b>r</b> in both signatures, rather than randomly generating a new one. There are some other restrictions on these values (described under "limits") that rule out certain special cases.
</p>

<p>
The last part of each test case will be an encrypted message (<b>c_1,c_2</b>) intended for Alice and encrypted by ElGamal encryption using her public key. This means that the sender, Bob, has taken his message <b>D</b> (intended for Alice), then chosen an "ephermal key" <b>b</b> at random and computed numbers <b>c_1,c_2</b> such that <b>c_1 ≡ g<sup>b</sup></b> mod <b>p</b> and <b>c_2 ≡ y<sup>b</sup> D</b> mod <b>p</b>.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to decrypt Bob's encrypted message and determine the original message <b>D</b>.
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The first line gives the number of test cases, <b>T</b>. <b>T</b> test cases follow. Each case consists of four lines, of the following form.
</p>
<p>
<b><tt>
g y p<br />
m_1 r s_1<br />
m_2 r s_2<br />
c_1 c_2<br />
</tt></b>
</p>

<p>
The first line is Alice's public key. The next two lines are two signed messages from Alice (note that they use the same value of <b>r</b>). The last line is an encrypted message intended for Alice.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
For each test case, print a single line of the form <tt>Case #<b>X</b>: <b>D</b></tt>, where <b>X</b> is the number of the test case and <b>D</b> is the original document that was encrypted by Alice's public key to obtain <b>c_1,c_2</b>.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<b>T</b> = 100<br />
<b>p</b> is a prime number.<br />
0 ≤ <b>g,y,m_1,m_2,r,s_1,s_2,c_1,c_2</b> ≤ <b>p</b>-1<br />
<b>g</b> is guaranteed to be a primitive root modulo <b>p</b>.<br />
The number <b>r</b> and the number <b>s_2-s_1</b> are both guaranteed to be relatively prime to <b>p</b>-1.<br />

<h3>Hints and suggestions</h3>

<p>
It is possible to solve the small input without using the signed messages at all -- simply determine the exponent <b>a</b> by trial and error, and then follow the procedure from the homework to decrypt the message <b>D</b> from it.
</p>

<p>
To solve the large input, you will need to use the signed messages from Alice. One good method is to let <b>e</b> be a number such that <b>g<sup>e</sup></b> ≡ <b>r</b> mod <b>p</b>. Using the fact that <b>g</b> is a primitive root, you can write down two congruences modulo <b>p</b>-1, involving both of the exponents <b>a</b> and <b>e</b>. You can manipulate these congruences in order to determine both of the values <b>a</b> and <b>e</b> (follow a similar method to when you solve a pair of linear equations). Then you can descrypt the message using the number <b>a</b>.
