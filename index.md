I am a mathematician at Amherst College. My research is in algebraic geometry and combinatorics, especially algebraic curves and Young tableaux. I am particularly interested in Brill-Noether theory, which studies the variety of ways that a chosen curve is realized in projective space. I also study analogous questions in the setting of tropical geometry, and the relation between these persepctives via non-Archimedean analytic geometry.

I teach a variety of courses at all levels at Amherst. I particularly enjoy teaching courses involving programming, such as my course in public key cryptography.
