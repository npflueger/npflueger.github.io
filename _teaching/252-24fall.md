This course concerns the mathematical problems underlying public-key ciphers and digital signatures, as well as algorithms to solve them. Topics may include discrete logarithms, integer factorization, elliptic curves, and lattices. These topics provide an appealing introduction to several topics in number theory, abstract algebra, and algorithms.

The course is designed for students with no prior experience in abstract algebra or programming. It serves as an introduction to those topics, meant to prepare students for more advanced courses. Students with prior experience are welcome, however.

You can find materials from previous offerings of this course here: [2023](../252-23spring), [2022](../252-22spring), [2020](../252-20spring), [2019](../252-19spring), [2016](../158-16fall), [2015](../158-15fall). The 2015 and 2016 courses, taught at Brown, were slightly different in style and emphasis.

Further information about this semester's course will be posted here soon.
