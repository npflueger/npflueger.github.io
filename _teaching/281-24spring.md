This course emphasizes enumerative combinatorics, a classical subject in mathematics related to the theory of counting. Problems in this area often pertain to finding the number of possible arrangements of a set of objects under some particular constraints. This course incorporates a wide set of problems involving enumerative combinatorics, as well as theory and applications.

### Exams
There will be two midterms and a three hour final exam. **Mark the midterm dates on your calendar now.**

* Midterm 1 will be in class on Wednesday 2/28.
    * You are allowed a **one page notesheet, front and back,** so that you don't need to memorize formulas. Put some time into it -- deciding what to put on the note sheet is a very useful study process!


* Midterm 2 will be in class on Wednesday 4/10.
    * You are allowed a **one page notesheet, front and back,** so that you don't need to memorize formulas. Put some time into it -- deciding what to put on the note sheet is a very useful study process!
    * The exam is not cumulative -- covered material begins with the first topic not covered on Midterm 1.


* The final exam date is scheduled by the registar, and will be posted here when it is determined.
     * You are allowed a **one page notesheet, front and back,** so that you don't need to memorize formulas. Put some time into it -- deciding what to put on the note sheet is a very useful study process!
    * The exam will be cumulative, though with increased emphasis on the material not yet covered on the midterms.
