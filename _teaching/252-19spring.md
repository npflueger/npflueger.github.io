This course concerns the mathematical problems underlying public-key ciphers and digital signatures, as well as algorithms to solve them. Topics include discrete logarithms, integer factorization, elliptic curves, and lattices. These topics provide an appealing introduction to several topics in number theory, abstract algebra, and algorithms.

    *   Some exams from previous versions of the course:
        
        *   NOTE: in past versions, midterm 2 came earlier in the semester, before elliptic curves. Therefore I've included some previous final exams here, with the elliptic curve problem identified, so you can try those specific problems for review.
        *   [2015 Midterm 2](handouts/midterm2-2015.pdf) / [Solutions](handouts/2015midterm2soln.pdf) (skip \#5, since we didn't discuss groups in general)
