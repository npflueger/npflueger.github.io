This course is an introduction to abstract algebra, a central pillar of modern mathematics that concerns generalizations of the familiar addition and multiplication operations from ordinary arithmetic. The course focuses on three types of algebraic structures: groups, rings, and fields. For each structure, we study certain transformations between such structures, a library of important examples, and ways to construct one object from another. Time permitting, we will discuss several applications of abstract algebra, including a preview of public-key cryptography (a subject that I will most likely teach a semester-long course about in the spring).

### LaTeX resources

*   [Overleaf LaTeX tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-1): this tutorial is a nice introduction for beginners. It focuses on using Overleaf, which allows you to write LaTeX documents online without installing any software.
*   [Overleaf Primer](handouts/OverleafPrimer.pdf) by Kristin Heysse (Macalester). Another tutorial on writing in LaTeX on Overleaf.
*   [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html): this is an absurdly useful tool that allows you to sketch a symbol and quickly learn the LaTeX command for it.

### Exams

*   Midterm 1: Friday 10/5
    
    *   Sample exams from previous semesters:
        
        *   __Note:__ These exams should give some impression of the length and format of the exam, but the topic coverage is slightly different from previous semesters. In particular: both exams use topics from Chapter 6 (direct products), and use the notation Z(G) (for the center of a group G) that we have not used in class.
        *   [Spring 2016](https://lms.ats.amherst.edu/pluginfile.php/577421/mod_resource/content/1/exam1.pdf)
