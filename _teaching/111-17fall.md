### Homework

Problem sets will be posted here. All problem sets will be submitted online via Gradescope. If I say that a problem set is on the "Wednesday night," this means that the hard deadline is 2am on the following Thursday morning.

All problem numbers are from Stewart, 7th edition. __ Problems marked "self-check" are not to be handed in.__ I've included them as suggestions for additional practice; usually they are odd-numbered and you can check your answer in the back of the book. I will sometimes put self-check problems on exams, so that some problems will already be familiar.

*   [Course survey](pset0.pdf) and Gradescope instructions. Use this to practice submitting on the Gradescope system.

<h3>Partial lecture notes</h3>
I will upload typed lecture notes below for many (but not all) of our classes. These notes are slightly edited versions of a complete set of lecture notes from an earlier course I taught (which you can find <a href="../math1a/index.html">here</a> if you want to see later topics as well). Note that the notes below usual include several more examples than I have time to do in class; these may serve as useful review material.
