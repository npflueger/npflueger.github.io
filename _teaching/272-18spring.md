### Office Hours

There are many sources of help in this class; you should make use of all of them! Here are a few places you can go with your questions.

### Mathematica Labs

Mathematica is available for all college-owned computers, and is already installed in all of the public labs, e.g. in on the first floor of Seeley Mudd. If you are using a public computer, be sure to __save your work to your personal user folder__, or you may end up losing your work when you log out. On the other hand, you should also be sure to delete any files accidentally saved to the desktop or hard drive of these public computers to ensure that they are not visible to the next person who uses that computer.

Mathematica can also be installed on your own computer through the college's [software drive](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/it/knowledge_base/software/college-install), or accessed through a [remote desktop connection](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/it/knowledge_base/network-wifi/Remote_Desktop_Connection). The college has a limited number of Mathematica licenses, so be sure to quit Mathematica when you are finished; otherwise, you may prevent another student from being able to use it.

During the in-class labs, you may feel free to bring your own laptop and use it instead of the lab machines, as long as you have installed Mathematica.
