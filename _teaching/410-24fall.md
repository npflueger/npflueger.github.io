Galois Theory is the study of symmetry in the solutions to polynomial equations. In its modern formulation, it describes a beatiful correspondence between field extensions and certain symmetry groups. We will develop this theory starting from a basic knowledge of groups, rings, and fields. One of our main goals will be to prove that there is no general version of the quadratic formula for a polynomial of degree five or more. Along the way, we will also show that a circular cake can be divided into 17 (but not 7) equal slices using only a straight-edged knife.
