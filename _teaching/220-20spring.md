coursenum: "Math 220"
section: 2
coursename: "Mathematical Reasoning and Proof"

startdate: 2020-01
semester: "Spring 2020"

This course serves as an introduction to mathematical reasoning and pays particular attention to helping students learn how to write proofs. The topics covered may include logic, elementary set theory, functions, relations and equivalence relations, mathematical induction, sequences, and quantifiers. 

### Remote learning

Following the transition to remote learning after Spring break, the structure of the course will be changed as follows.

*   We will have synchronous class meetings via Zoom at 9am on Mondays and Fridays. See the Zoom link on the course moodle page for access.
*   Several pre-recorded videos will be posted on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. You may access these from the Dropbox link sent out by email (also linked from the Moodle page).
*   Office hours: during my scheduled office hours (below), I will be actively monitoring the class's Slack channel, answering questions, and opening Zoom discussions as needed. Please set a message to the channel or to me privately if you would like to start a Zoom meeting.
*   The remaining exams will be open-book take-home exams (see below for details).
*   We will almost certainly cover less material this semester than was originally planned on the syllabus, due to the extraordinary circumstances. My primary concern as the instructor right now is to prioritize the main learning goals of Math 220: giving you practice and challenges to develop your proof-writing and problem solving skills so that you are prepared for future courses.
