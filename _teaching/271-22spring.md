This course concerns the core theory of linear algebra, with specific attention to the theoretical development necessary for pure mathematics. The primary objective is to introduce and examine the notion of a *vector space*, which is a simple model for geometry in any number of dimensions. A secondary objective is to develop and practice mathematical writing, especially the vocabulary, techniques, and mechanics of writing proofs.

Topics include the concepts of vector space, subspace, linear independence, basis, and dimension; systems of linear equations and their solution by Gaussian elimination; matrix operations; linear transformations and their representations by matrices; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; and inner product spaces.

### LaTeX resources

*   [Allison Tanguay's LaTeX resource page](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/atanguay/latex)
*   [Overleaf LaTeX tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials): some tutorial videos and other links about learning LaTeX. These focus on using Overleaf, an online platform to write LaTeX documents online without installing any software.
*   [Overleaf Primer](handouts/OverleafPrimer.pdf) by Kristin Heysse (Macalester). Another tutorial on writing in LaTeX on Overleaf.
*   [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html): this is an absurdly useful tool that allows you to sketch a symbol and quickly learn the LaTeX command for it.
