This course concerns the mathematical problems underlying public-key ciphers and digital signatures, as well as algorithms to solve them. Topics include discrete logarithms, integer factorization, elliptic curves, and lattices. These topics provide an appealing introduction to several topics in number theory, abstract algebra, and algorithms.

The course is designed for students with no prior experience in abstract algebra or programming. It serves as an introduction to those topics, meant to prepare students for more advanced courses. Students with prior experience are welcome, however.

You can find materials from previous offerings of this course here: [2020](../252-20spring), [2019](../252-19spring), [2016](../158-16fall), [2015](../158-15fall). The 2015 and 2016 courses, taught at Brown, were sligtly different in style and emphasis.

### Exams

* Midterm 1 will be on Friday 3/25 in class.
    * Remember to make a one-page note-sheet (front and back)! Tables 2.2 and 2.3 from the textbook (summary of Diffie-Hellman and Elgamal) will be included in the exam packet, so you do not need to copy any of that information to your note sheet.
    * Coverage: anything discussed in class up to Friday 3/11. This includes the following textbook sections: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7.
    * Some old exams, for review. Note that coverage and emphasis differs on these exams, and in particular the 2015 and 2016 exams are somewhat more difficult that ours is likely to be.
