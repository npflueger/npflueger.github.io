This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post. 
Is this part of the excerpt, when the excerpt field isn't explicitly set? Yes. Single newlines don't create new paragraphs.
Let's see if mathjax is working. Single dollar signs: $\int_0^1 \sqrt{1-x^2} dx$ and double dollar signs: $$\displaystyle W^\lambda = \bigcup_{t \vdash \lambda} \mathbb{T}(t).$$ Also parens: \\( \chi(G^r_d) \\). They all work!

Is this still part of the excerpt? Nope... I guess the excerpt is always the first paragraph of content. That's good to know.
