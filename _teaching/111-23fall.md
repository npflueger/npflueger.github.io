### Exams

* Midterm 1 will be in class on Friday 9/29.
    * You are allowed a **one page notesheet, front and back,** so that you don't need to memorize formulas. Put some time into it -- deciding what to put on the note sheet is a very useful study process!
    * Coverage (tentative -- check for updates closer to exam): Sections 1.1-1.6 (but not 1.7 or 1.8), and 2.1-2.2.
    * Some [review problems](exams/practice1.pdf) / [solutions](exams/sol_practice1.pdf), gratefully borrowed from Rob Benedetto. You may ignore all questions asking about where a graph is discontinuous.
