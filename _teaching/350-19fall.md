This course is an introduction to abstract algebra, a central pillar of modern mathematics that concerns generalizations of the familiar addition and multiplication operations from ordinary arithmetic. The course focuses on three types of algebraic structures: groups, rings, and fields. For each structure, we study certain transformations between such structures, a library of important examples, and ways to construct one object from another. Time permitting, we will discuss several applications of abstract algebra, including a preview of public-key cryptography.

### LaTeX resources

*   [Overleaf LaTeX tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials): some tutorial videos and other links about learning LaTeX. These focus on using Overleaf, an online platform to write LaTeX documents online without installing any software.
*   [Overleaf Primer](handouts/OverleafPrimer.pdf) by Kristin Heysse (Macalester). Another tutorial on writing in LaTeX on Overleaf.
*   [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html): this is an absurdly useful tool that allows you to sketch a symbol and quickly learn the LaTeX command for it.

        *    __Note:__ content varies term to term, so don't treat these as absolute guides to what we've covered. In particular, these don't really emphasize the following topics are emphasized more this semester: _Group actions, quadratic integer rings, linear algebra examples_.

    *   Some sample exams with solutions are below. Note that __handwritten notes on these are from Fall 2018__, so they may not perfectly match the coverage and notation from this year. Please ask if you are unsure of any notations or coverage issues.

    *   Many more old final exams are [here](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics/resources-opportunities/mathfinals/math_350). These don't have solutions, but feel free to ask me at office hours about any of the problems. Also remember that notation and coverage may be slightly different every term.
    *   [Old math comps](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics/major/compexam/oldcomps) exams may also be useful for studying (only look at the Algebra sections).
