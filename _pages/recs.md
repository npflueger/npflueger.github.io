I write many recommendation letters per year, and it is a very important part of my job. To help the process run as smoothly as possible, please review this information before requesting a reference.

## Deadlines

Request any references at least **four weeks in advance**, and send me **all supporting materials at least two weeks before the first deadline**.

## What I need from you

Please send me all of the following information when requesting a reference. Even if I have written for you before, it is useful to have the information in one place.

1. A short summary of our interactions in classes you've taken from me, especially any anecdotes or aspects of your work that you think I should highlight in the letter. 
1. Your CV / resume.
1. Your transcript.
1. Everything you will submit with your application (drafts are fine).
1. Names of your other letter writers.
1. A brief description of the programs or jobs to which you are applying, with deadlines.
1. Detailed submission instructions, including where I should send letters and any submission webpages.

## Reminders

If a deadline is several days away and I have not yet submitted my letter, please send me a gentle reminder.
