The most reliable way to reach me is by email. For course-related issues, I will usually reply within 24 hours. I generally do not check my work email outside of business hours or on weekends, so please be patient if you contact me at those times.

**email:** My first initial and last name at amherst dot edu.

**Office:** Seeley Mudd 401
