I am a mathematician at Amherst College, specializing in algebraic geometry and combinatorics. I teach a variety of courses at all levels at Amherst. I particularly enjoy teaching courses involving programming.

I grew up in Seattle, and still miss the mountains all around, but I am a happy East coast transplant. I enjoy the snowy winters and all the scenery around the Pioneer valley. I cycle daily along the Norwottuck Rail Trail from my home in Northampton to the Amherst campus, and can often be found exploring the surrounding area by bicycle when time allows it.

My first exposure to beautiful mathematics was by seeking out elementary but challenging problems outside of school. I owe a lot to the original [Art of Problem Solving](https://www.artofproblemsolving.com) books, which showed me a whole world I had not imagined before. I aim to emphasize intuition, creativity, and problem-solving in all of my courses. I firmly believe that mathematics is most useful, and most satisfying, for the habits of mind it fosters, rather than the facts or formulas one may learn along the way.

I am on leave for research until January 2022.
